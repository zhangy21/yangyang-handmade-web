                    <p>What if we did not go back, but went forward? Not, that is, corrected the mistake, or flagged it for study, or for shame, but proceeded as though it were no mistake as though it were meaningful, and implied rules that might be trusted in language at large?       
                                                    â€“Jeff Dolven<br>
                 <br>
                        Jeff Dolven considers sentences with incorrect grammar to be meaningful language and uses them to create new language, particularly in the form of poetry. New English Grammar endeavors to construct new languages from flawed sentences, constituting a series of experiments. Through the utilization of graphics, typography, and imagery on paper, it explores new possibilities.
