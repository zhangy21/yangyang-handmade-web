                    <p>I found that the items with imitated luxury graphics that I see in daily life have some common characteristics, such as, they are repeated composition with elements of a single logo and  used in chaotic environments and some ordinary inferior products. At the same time, merchants regard Logo as a symbol of profit-seeking.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    In order to satirize the operation model of luxury products with a single logo, and the production model of merchants who copy luxury products taking the opportunity to pursue profit, I made a series of installations with cheap daily necessities and decorated them with my newly created graphics, aiming to create a sense of contradiction between the visual symbols of plagiarized luxury goods and life in a humorous and interesting way.</p>
